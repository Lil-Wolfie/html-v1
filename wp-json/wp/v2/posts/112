A compass is a simple instrument that consists of two hinged legs, with a pointed end on one leg and a pencil or pen on the other. The pointed end is used to draw the circles, while the pencil or pen is used to mark the circumference of the circle.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why compasses are needed in geometry. One reason is that they allow for the precise construction of circles. When drawing a circle by hand, it can be difficult to get the size and shape exactly right. With a compass, however, it is easy to create a perfect circle with a consistent radius. This is because the pointed end of the compass stays in the same place as the pencil or pen is moved around the circumference of the circle.<\/p>\n<p>Another reason why compasses are needed in geometry is that they allow for the measurement of distances. By setting the compass to a specific distance and drawing a circle, it is possible to measure the distance between two points on a flat surface. This is especially useful when working with large distances or when it is not possible to use a ruler.<\/p>\n<p>Compasses are also useful for creating geometric shapes that are based on circles, such as ellipses and regular polygons. By adjusting the size of the radius and the number of sides, it is possible to create a wide variety of shapes using a compass.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to their practical uses, compasses are also an important symbol in geometry. The compass is often used as a symbol for geometry itself, as it represents the tools and techniques used to study geometric shapes and their properties. The compass is also often used in logos and other graphical representations of geometry.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, compasses are an essential tool in geometry. Whether you are working with simple circles or more complex geometric shapes, a compass is a valuable tool for creating and measuring geometric figures.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Compasses are a key tool in geometry, as they are used to draw circles and measure distances on a flat surface or plane.
